[2010-02-10] Better testing for broken entries in logical log
    Currently the test code for broken entries does not test all possible 
    combinations of broken entries (meaning crash during write of entry so it 
    was incomplete). This is fine since a broken command entry will never be 
    executed because it would then have to have a following prepare entry (can 
    not happen since we do flush on them). Would however be nice to have code 
    that tests this so user don't get an exception on recovery.
