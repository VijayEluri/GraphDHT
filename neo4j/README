Prototype to test how Neo4j runs with an Hashtable underneath.

Notes:
  - org.neo4j.graphdb.GraphDatabaseService - 
 * The main access point to a running Neo4j instance. The most common
 * implementation is the {@link EmbeddedGraphDatabase} class, which is used to
 * embed Neo4j in an application. Typically, you would create an
 * <code>EmbeddedGraphDatabase</code> instance as follows:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * <code>GraphDatabaseService graphDb = new EmbeddedGraphDatabase( "var/graphDb" );
 * // ... use Neo4j
 * graphDb.{@link #shutdown() shutdown()};</code>
 * </pre>
 * 
 * GraphDatabaseService provides operations to {@link #enableRemoteShell enable
 * the shell}, {@link #createNode() create nodes}, {@link #getNodeById(long) get
 * nodes given an id}, get the {@link #getReferenceNode() reference node} and
 * ultimately {@link #shutdown() shutdown Neo4j}.
 * <p>
 * Please note that all operations that read or write to the graph must be
 * invoked in a {@link Transaction transactional context}. Failure to do so will
 * result in a {@link NotInTransactionException} being thrown.
